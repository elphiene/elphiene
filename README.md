# Cherry's Labs

A collaborative project between cherry and el showcasing their projects, programs, and 3D printed creations.

## Dual-Site Architecture

This repository contains **two versions** of the same website:

### 🍒 Retro Version (`/retro`)
- Y2K/old web aesthetic
- For web design enthusiasts
- **Status**: Active development
- [View retro README](retro/README.md)

### ✨ Modern Version (`/modern`)
- Contemporary, clean UI
- For broader audience appeal
- **Status**: Not yet started
- [View modern README](modern/README.md)

## Quick Start

### View the Retro Site

Open `retro/index.html` in your web browser.

### View the Modern Site

Open `modern/index.html` in your web browser.

## Project Goals

- Showcase cherry + el's collaborative projects
- Display programs and software development work
- Sell 3D printed items and future gadgets/tech
- Provide documentation and knowledge base (wiki)

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies
- Designed to be maintainable by site owners
- Static files served directly

## Content Sync Strategy

Both retro and modern versions will ideally share the same content (projects, products, posts), though implementation details are TBD based on how different the two designs become.

## Development Notes

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidance, architecture notes, and coding conventions.
