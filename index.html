                    this idea came from me desperately for a program that could
                    run a sort of dashboard and could be used as an always on
                    display for me at work, with the kinds of things i need to
                    be checking a lot, but didn't want to be wasting time
                    checking a million pages. turns out most programs to do this
                    are for servers, or entire operating systems.

                        an idea cherry and i came up with when we we're talking

                    the concept behind the pager is is a small e-ink display
                    with a slide out keyboard (you remember those phones in the
                    weird flip-phone maximalism era where every company had a
                    million insane phone designs? i miss that) with a few
                    buttons programmed to send different messages and run
                    different applications! it's a huge work in progress and
                    we'll need to 3D print the casing for it probably but its a
                    cool idea!
