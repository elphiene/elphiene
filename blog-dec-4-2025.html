        <h3>21 now</h3>
        <pre>
            i turned 21 a few days ago! i dont feel much different. i have had a fucking insanely busy morning tho.
            i get to work to a billion proofs i have to do and i asked my coworker before i left if he could cut them off the printer
            and put them in the drawer for me and he said yes and then what do i show up to at 6am??
            a roll of proofs literally 3/4x my height. how am i supposed to manage this.
            if he cut them off as they printed IT WOULDVE BEEN FINE. anyway that genuinbely took 3 hours and i've finally sat down.
            we had some crazy issues with the printer yesterday and tosay cause there was a huge ink build up for some reason
            and everyone is being very casual about this fact because i've cleaned up all the ink and they seem to think that now ive cleaned up the problem,
            it means theres no more problem BUT WHERE IS THE INK COMING FROM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!
            whatevs. im gonna run this place like the navy when i finish my apprenticeship.
            i have become shockingly knowledgeable, especially in roland printers.
